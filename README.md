# Victorian Scribblers Data
This repository houses data collected and used in the making of the Victorian Scribblers podcast.

## Project Description
<em>Victorian Scribblers</em> is a biography and literature podcast about the lives and work of lesser-known Victorian writers. Researched, produced, and co-hosted by Dr. Courtney Floyd (UVa) and Eleanor Dumbill (Loughborough University), the podcast is envisioned as a public humanities project. In the podcast, we unpack the human contexts of the Victorian period for a mixed audience of scholars and enthusiasts, highlighting nineteenth-century writers whom time and the Western canon have forgotten. Now in its third season, <em>Victorian Scribblers</em> has covered the life and work of Wilkie Collins, Mary Elizabeth Braddon, the Trollope family, and Mary Shelley. We have also produced a miniseries titled <em>Victorian Adaptations / Adapting the Victorians</em> which featured interdisciplinary conversations with experts in Art History, Medieval Literature and Culture, and rare books. 

## Use / Interpretation of Victorian Data
One of our aims for the podcast is to provide listeners with ways to keep exploring the world of nineteenth-century writers, and that means sharing our data. On our website, we provide resources along with each episode, author pages where listeners can access all of our coverege on a given author, and timelines associated with author's lives. We'd like to have a site-wide, aggregate timeline, but haven't yet found an existing one that suits our needs. We're in the process of working out how to build our own, but in the meantime we're sharing our large (and growing) timeline .csv with you here. We may also house other things (such as transcripts, data visualizations, etc.) at a later date.
